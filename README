Dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

Handy sites :
http://json2csharp.com/  - to create models
http://jsonformat.com/   - to see formatted JSON output

Note this is take a divergence from the original GithubSharp.
- Using json.net as it it is a more commonly used library (and service stack failed to deserilaze some json types)
- Splitting our the API calls that require Auth and those that do not.
- Models and urls are being updated to the v3 sepc
- basic integration tests are being added that call back onto this github repo
